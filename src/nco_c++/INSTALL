Purpose: Installation instructions for libnco_c++

The libnco_c++ distribution is currently maintained as a
directory of the NCO distribution in nco/src/nco_c++.
This is available from nco.sf.net or by anonymous FTP from

ftp://dust.ess.uci.edu/pub/zender/nco/nco.tar.gz

Build libnco_c++ with the Makefile generated by configure.
If this fails, try using the handwritten Makefile.old---type
'make -f Makefile.old' using GNU make. 
Makefile.old requires GNU make and Perl to be in your executable path.
By default, this will build the library libnco_c++.a,
the test program tst, and the test input data file in.nc.
