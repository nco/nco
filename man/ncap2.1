.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ncap2
supersedes and is backwards-compatible with 
.B ncap
which is now deprecated.
Both operators arithmetically process netCDF files.
The primary 
.B ncap2 
documentation is currently the sample script
<http://nco.sf.net/ncap2.in> 
The remainder of this manpage is identical to the 
.B ncap
manpage.

The processing instructions are contained either in the 
.B NCO
script file 
.B fl.nco
or in a sequence of command line arguments.
The options 
.B \-s
(or long options 
.B \-\-spt
or 
.B \-\-script)
are used for in-line scripts and 
.B \-S
(or long options 
.B \-\-fl_spt
or 
.B \-\-script-file)
are used to provide the filename where (usually multiple) scripting
commands are pre-stored.    
.B ncap2
was written to perform arbitrary albebraic
transformations of data and archive the results as easily as possible.
Missing values are treated correctly.
The results of the algebraic manipulations are called 
.I derived fields. 

Unlike the other operators, 
.B ncap2
does not accept a list of
variables to be operated on as an argument to 
.B \-v.
Rather, the 
.B \-v 
switch takes no arguments and indicates that 
.B ncap2
should output 
.I only
user-defined variables. 
.B ncap2
does not accept or understand the 
.B \-x 
switch.

The full documentation for

Because

is mathematical in nature, the documentation includes TeX-intensive
portions not viewable on character-based displays. 
Hence the only complete and authoritative versions of the

are the PDF (recommended), DVI, and Postscript versions at
<http://nco.sf.net/nco.pdf>, <http://nco.sf.net/nco.dvi>,

If the

TeX-intensive portions.
