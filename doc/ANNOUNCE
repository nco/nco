The netCDF operators NCO version 4.0.0 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage)
http://dust.ess.uci.edu/nco (Homepage "mirror")

This version offers significant new features:
Chunking on all operators, GSL fitting, bilinear interpolation.

Short explanations of these appear below.

Work on NCO 4.0.1 is underway. Areas of improvement include

Spectral transforms.

"New stuff" details:

A. NCO recognizes more variables that are coordinate variables
   or multi-dimensional coordinate variables and does not attempt
   to arithmetically process (e.g., difference) these in most
   situations. This allows more convenient manipulation of, e.g.,
   CLM and NARCCAP files.

B. ncap2 supports the GSL (Chapter 2) fitting routines, e.g., fxm
   ncap2 -v -O -s 'defdim("dmn",100);sigma[dmn]=1.0;var1=gsl_ran_gaussian(sigma);var2=gsl_stats_skew(var1);print(var2)' in.nc out.nc
   ncap2 functions added since 3.9.9 are listed below

C. All NCO operators supports netCDF4 chunking options:
   These options can improve performance on large datasets.
   Large file users: Send us suggestions on useful chunking patterns!
   More usefule chunking patterns will be implemented in NCO 4.0.1.
   ncks -O -4 --cnk_plc=all in.nc out.nc

D. NCO improves support for the netCDF4 NC_STRING atomic type.
   An "s" trailing double quotes specifies NC_STRING (not NC_CHAR):
   ncap2 -4 -O -v -s 'name[lat]={"US"s,"Them"s};' in.nc out.nc
   Ragged arrays of strings are finally here! Let's use them.

E. Dimension-reduction to scalars works with irregular hyperslabs.
   Commands that now work include
   scalar=avg(three_dmn_var_dbl(0:1,:,0:3));
   scalar=total(three_dmn_var_dbl(0:1,:,0:3)); 
   Formerly these required multiple steps to ensure that the
   intermediate dimension sizes used in the hyperslabs were present 
   on disk. 

G. Support CF "calendar" attribute = no_leap, 360_day, 365_day.
   Now time-based hyperslabs understand common model calendars!
   This greatly eases analyzing datasets such as the CMIP3/AR4 GCMs

H. OpenSuse packages are now available (Filipe Fernandes)

"Sticky" reminders:

K. Pre-built, up-to-date Debian Sid & Ubuntu Jaunty/Karmic packages:
   http://nco.sf.net#debian

L. Pre-built Fedora and CentOS RPMs:

M. Find/add NCO tips and tricks on the NCO Wiki:

   http://nco.wiki.sourceforge.net

N. Did you try SWAMP (Script Workflow Analysis for MultiProcessing)?
   SWAMP efficiently schedules/executes NCO scripts on remote servers:  

   http://swamp.googlecode.com

   SWAMP can work command-line operator analysis scripts besides NCO. 
   If you must transfer lots of data from a server to your client
   before you analyze it, then SWAMP will likely speed things up. 

O. NCO support for netCDF4 features is tracked at

   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#nco4

   NCO supports netCDF4 atomic data types, compression, and chunking.
   NCO 4.0.0 with was built and tested with HDF5 1.8.3-snap2 and with
   netCDF4 4.1-beta1-snapshot2009061712.
   NCO may not build with earlier, but should build with later, netCDF4 releases.
   This is particularly true since NCO 4.0.0 takes advantage of
   an internal change to the netCDF API in June 2007 for
   nc_def_var_chunking(). 

   export NETCDF4_ROOT=/usr/local/netcdf4 # Set netCDF4 location
   cd ~/nco;./configure --enable-netcdf4  # Configure mechanism -or-
   cd ~/nco/bld;./make NETCDF4=Y allinone # Old Makefile mechanism
